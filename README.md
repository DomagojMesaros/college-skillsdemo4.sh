An attempt to automate skills demo 4 for college

Commands to run in terminal in order

1.Make sure that you have wget installed

sudo apt install wget

2.After that is installed run

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomagojMesaros/college-skillsdemo4.sh/refs/heads/main/skill_demo4.sh

This will download the script to your current user Downloads folder or ~/Downloads

3.Change directory to Downloads

cd ~/Downloads

4.Make the script executable

chmod +x skill_demo4.sh

5.Run script

./skill_demo4.sh

6.The script has pauses enabled to allow you to take screenshots. It will wait for you to press ENTER after every step so don't press ENTER before you took a screenshot

7.The script only works if you are logged in as sudo user and have all the groups and users from skills demo 3 setup.

8. This will not create a text file for you and will not showcase user permissions in GUI so you ahve to do that yourself.
9. PRofit???
